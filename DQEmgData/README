This data file implemtation is designed to be forward/backward
compatible with new versions.

Docs for the use of this spec are in the "docs" directory, in
HTML and text formats.


Coding style in this project is as follows:

  - 8-space tabs with 4-space indent

  - all private data/function members names end with a '_'.

  - Types begin with a capital, variables/functions do not

  - Every function in the public interface must have
    a full descriptive comment in the form:

    ////////////////////////////////////////
    // Description of function
    int func();

    The row of '///' characters allows the associated
    doc files to be built using the cocoon utilities.


NOTE:
In order to maintain the forward/backward compatibility, new
data elements can only be introduced at the end of the existing
list.  To do otherwise will completely break the ability of
earlier versions to read later data files.

It appears as though things really went off the rails at v1.24,
where onset_ thorugh end_ we placed in ahead of channelDescription_.


PatientId _should_ be after the contraction type!
